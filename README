This file is a table of contents for my QuickSort algorithm:

1) README - this file.

2) SortStrings.c - executable C file that takes n strings from an in file and 
   sorts them in order then copies them to an outfile.
   Usage: in the command line, enter "SortStrings <input file name> <output file name>",
          where the input file is a list of strings separated by new lines.

3) Makefile - a file used to automate compilation, submission, and valgrind.

4) in.txt - sample input file containing a list of unsorted strings

5) out.txt - sample output file containing a sorted list of strings (from the input 
   file above).
